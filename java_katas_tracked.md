I learnt about parseInt and if the string is empty it will throw errors, so account for that in the return. Also condition of .equals() rather than ===.

I learnt about integer division versus double division, adding the .0 on 100 prevents any loss in precision.

To concatenate strings, you must establish that "String letters" is actually a string, in this instance I explicitly converted the first character from a char to a string, any other chars added would then be allowed.

Divide and multiply by 100.0 not 100, established both as floats too - integer arithmetic truncates the decimals, so I avoided that.

Solved this okay, system.out.print() doesnt allow a number of outputs seperated by a comma, you can concatinate the string but the comma doesn't allow two variables to print next to each other.

Removing Elements <br>

Java arrays are fixed in size, and you cannot dynamically resize them using the push method.
Use an ArrayList to dynamically store the elements and then convert it back to an array before returning.
